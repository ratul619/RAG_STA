The Conversational Future of Timing Analysis
What if you could have a conversation with your STA results instead of writing custom scripts for every tool and corner? I built something that makes this possible using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technology powered by CodeLlama 7B LLM.
Why RAG over Fine-tuning? RAG combines a pre-trained language model with a knowledge base, allowing it to access specific information while maintaining conversational abilities. For timing analysis, this means the system can understand both general language patterns AND specific technical data from PrimeTime reports. Fine-tuning would require massive datasets of timing-specific conversations and would lose the ability to adapt to new report formats.
Implementation Flow:
  Parse PrimeTime reports into structured JSON (handles multiple paths, derate/delta formatting)
  Embed timing data using SentenceTransformer for semantic search
  Store in ChromaDB vector database for fast retrieval
  Query using CodeLlama 7B for natural language understanding
  Respond with precise technical answers
