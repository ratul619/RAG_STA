The Conversational Future of Timing Analysis

What if you could have a conversation with your STA results instead of writing custom scripts for every tool and corner? I built something that makes this possible using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technology powered by DialoGPT-large.

Why RAG over Fine-tuning? RAG combines a pre-trained language model with a knowledge base, allowing it to access specific information while maintaining conversational abilities. For timing analysis, this means the system can understand both general language patterns AND specific technical data from PrimeTime reports. Fine-tuning would require massive datasets of timing-specific conversations and would lose the ability to adapt to new report formats.

Implementation Flow:
  Parse PrimeTime reports into structured JSON (handles multiple paths, derate/delta formatting)
  Embed timing data using SentenceTransformer for semantic search
  Store in ChromaDB vector database for fast retrieval
  Query using DialoGPT-large for natural language understanding
  Respond with precise technical answers

Real Output Example:

Q: "What is the worst slack?"
A: "The worst slack is 0.3252ns for the path from chip_core/housekeeping/_6778_ to chip_core/housekeeping/_6778_ in group hkspi_clk."

Q: "What is the clock skew for that slack?"
A: "The clock skew for the path from chip_core/housekeeping/_6778_ to chip_core/housekeeping/_6778_ is 0.4998999999999967ns."

Q: "How much is the hold time requirement for that path?"
A: "The hold time requirement for the path from chip_core/housekeeping/_6778_ to chip_core/housekeeping/_6778_ is 0.1002ns."

Instead of spending hours writing parsing scripts for STA  reports, engineers can now simply ask "What's the worst slack?" or "Show me paths that got worse from synthesis to routing" and get instant, comprehensive answers. The system automatically adapts to any report format, eliminating the need to develop new parsing flows every time a tool updates or a new corner is added.

For semiconductor companies, keeping data local is paramount. Every timing report contains sensitive design information that cannot leave the premises. This GenAI solution runs entirely on your local infrastructure, ensuring complete data privacy while providing the conversational interface that makes timing analysis intuitive and efficient.

The Impact: This is just a basic application demonstrating the potential. With advanced development, we could have:
  Multi-tool report comparison
  Automated timing closure recommendations
  Interactive timing path visualization
  Cross-corner analysis

The future of EDA tools is conversational. No more custom scripts, no more format parsing headaches - just ask your timing data what you need to know.
